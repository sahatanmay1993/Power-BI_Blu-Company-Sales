Blu Company is a multifaceted enterprise with successful ventures across various product ranges and a prominent presence in the real estate sector. 
The company's global business head requires a dashboard to track key metrics related to the sales quantities and gross margins (GM) managed by nine business unit managers (executives). 
This dashboard will also be accessible to internal business stakeholders and clients for continuous monitoring of sales and other statistics.

This project delivers a robust Power BI dashboard for Blu Company, enabling effective monitoring and analysis of sales performance across various categories and scenarios. 
By providing clear and actionable insights, the dashboard supports informed decision-making for both internal stakeholders and clients.
